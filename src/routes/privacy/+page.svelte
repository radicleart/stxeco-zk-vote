	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 16/Dec/2024</p>
	<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 16/Dec/2024</p>
	<p>
		BrightBlock values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard
		information when you use our Web3 application, including interactions with blockchain networks
		like Sui. By accessing or using BigMarket, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
	<h3>a. Wallet Address and On-Chain Data</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>What We Collect:</strong> Your wallet address and any public, on-chain data associated with
		your address.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Why We Collect It:</strong> To enable interactions with the Sui blockchain (e.g., verifying
		ownership, processing transactions).
	</p>

	<h3>b. Off-Chain Data</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Authentication Data:</strong> If you log in via Google OAuth (e.g., zkLogin), we may collect
		cryptographic proofs or minimal personal data such as email or user ID, depending on permissions
		granted.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Device Data:</strong> Technical data like your browser type, IP address, and device information
		may be collected for debugging and analytics.
	</p>

	<h3>c. Optional Data</h3>
	<p>
		If you voluntarily provide additional data (e.g., during customer support requests or via
		forms), we may store this securely.
	</p>

	<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Facilitate secure interactions with the Sui blockchain (e.g., transactions, zkLogin-based
			authentication).
		</li>
		<li>Provide core app functionality, such as user authentication, voting, or staking.</li>
		<li>Improve our app by analyzing usage trends and debugging errors.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties without your consent, except as
		required by law or for core functionality.
	</p>

	<h2>3. Decentralized Data Storage</h2>
	<p>Data stored on the blockchain is public and immutable. This means:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Transactions and wallet interactions are stored permanently on the Sui blockchain.</li>
		<li>We cannot delete, modify, or control this data once it is recorded.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Important:</strong> Use your wallet and private key responsibly. We cannot access your wallet
		or recover lost private keys.
	</p>

	<h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
	<p>We may use browser cookies or local storage for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Session management (e.g., storing ephemeral keys during zkLogin sessions).</li>
		<li>Preferences (e.g., theme settings or wallet connections).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can clear cookies and local storage through your browser settings.</p>

	<h2>5. Security</h2>
	<p>
		We employ industry-standard security practices to protect your data. However, as a Web3
		application interacting with decentralized networks, certain risks are beyond our control, such
		as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The exposure of public blockchain data.</li>
		<li>Phishing attacks or unauthorized wallet access.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always verify smart contract addresses and only interact with trusted
		networks.
	</p>

	<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
	<p>We may integrate third-party services like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Google OAuth</strong> for zkLogin.</li>
		<li>Blockchain explorers or node providers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These services may collect and process data independently. Please review their privacy policies
		for more information:

	<h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>

		"Last Updated" date at the top indicates the most recent revision. Continued use of [Your App
		Name] after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
